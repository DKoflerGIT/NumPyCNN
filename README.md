# Convolutional Neural Networks from scratch

Building a framework from scratch for Convolutional Neural Networks using NumPy.

cnn_ and densenn_ notebooks are using the model to train on datasets.
test_ notebooks were used to explore certain concepts, testing and developing algorithms for this model
